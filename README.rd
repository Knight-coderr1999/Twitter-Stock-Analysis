# Woodstock: Using Twitter Sentiments to Predict Stock Price Movements

## Overview

**Woodstock** is a real-time stock prediction system powered by sentiment analysis of Twitter data. By evaluating public sentiment surrounding companies and market trends, the project identifies correlations between social media buzz and stock price fluctuations. The goal is to help investors and analysts make data-driven decisions.

## System Architecture

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Tweets are collected via the Twitter API using Tweepy.
   - Streaming is handled through Amazon Kinesis.
   - Tweets are stored as CSV files in S3 via AWS Lambda.
   - Live stock prices are fetched using the Alpha Vantage API.
   - Real-time data updates are triggered and stored in Amazon DynamoDB.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Sentiments are extracted from tweets using **TextBlob** in real time.

3. **Data Integration**  
   - Sentiment scores are aligned with historical stock price data for modeling.

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Multiple models were tested: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and XGBoost.
   - **XGBoost** performed best after hyperparameter tuning.

5. **ML Lifecycle Management**  
   - **MLflow** is used to track experiments and manage model versions.

6. **User Interface**  
   - A **Streamlit** web app allows users to select stocks, view sentiment trends, and forecast price changes.
   - Deployed via **Hugging Face Spaces**.
